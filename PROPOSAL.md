## Description and Motivation
I am making an advancement to my java unit project by having it in a web page instead of the terminal and to keep the mainy functionality I had originally, but
add in other features I wanted to add still for the original project. *Short Description* My unit project dealt with a vet where someone at the front desk could
add details of an appointment someone made, update details of an appointment, or delete appointments. 

## Prior Art
This project will represent my java unit project, but on a web page.

## Core User Workflows
- Users can enter details of their visit
- Users can enter appointment details and choose available times
- Users can update details of the appointment
- Users can delete appointments
- Users can view all appointments
- Users can search appointments by time

#### Goals 
- Create the landing page for the vet which will have the sign up & login buttons with a header.
