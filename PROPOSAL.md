## Description and Motivation
I am making an advancement to my java unit project by having it in a web page instead of the terminal and to keep the mainy functionality I had originally, but
add in other features I wanted to add still for the original project. 

## Prior Art
This project will represent my java unit project, but on a web page.

## Core User Workflows
- Users can enter details of their visit
- Users can enter appointment details and choose available times
